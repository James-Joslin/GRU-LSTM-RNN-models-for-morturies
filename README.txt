The LSTM model and GRU model function well, with the GRU model reporting slighlty improved levels of loss, with a test RMSE of 9.67% less than that of the LSTM 
The seq2seq model is so far a failure 
Future work will look into multi output models to reduce the need for a recursive forecast output
SARIMA model added as baseline
Model outputs are not uploaded to github, however if you are curious about models that have already been built and don't want to run the training of your own contact me via teams
